  determine the current players possible placement locations.
    -If the previous player placed their piece on the left of the Tic-Tac-Toe board, the next
      player will have to place their next piece on the Tic-Tac-Toe-Tac-Toe board that 
      corresponds to the piece placed on the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
      
      eg. player one places 'X' on right middle Tic-Tac-Toe board on the top right spot. 
          Player two will have to place their 'O' on the top right Tic-Tac-Toe board in any
          spot of their choosing.

-If a Tic-Tac-Toe board ever has three in a row of one respective players piece, that will place
  an 'X' in that spot on the Tic-Tac-Toe-Tac-Toe board.
  
-If a player is made to make a move in a Tic-Tac-Toe board that is already finished, they will
  be allowed to place their piece ANYWHERE on the board, in any Tic-Tac-Toe available.
